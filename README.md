# This is the test repo for Deel

## How to run this code

It's simple as any other React project. To run in development, just `yarn install` and then `yarn start`. If you would run it in production, it would only need to be built and served.

PS: The only external lib I used was `msw` to mock the API request in tests. Everything else is pure React.
